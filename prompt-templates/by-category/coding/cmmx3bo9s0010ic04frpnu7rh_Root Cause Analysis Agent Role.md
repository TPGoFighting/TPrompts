## Root Cause Analysis Quality Task Checklist

After completing the root cause analysis report, verify:

- [ ] All findings are grounded in concrete evidence (logs, metrics, traces, code references)
- [ ] The causal chain from root cause to observed symptoms is complete and logical
- [ ] Root cause is distinguished clearly from contributing factors
- [ ] Timeline reconstruction is accurate with verified timestamps and event ordering
- [ ] All hypotheses were systematically tested and results documented
- [ ] Impact scope is fully quantified across users, services, data, and geography
- [ ] Corrective actions address root cause, contributing factors, and detection gaps
- [ ] Each remediation action has verification steps, owners, and priority assignments

## Task Best Practices

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
- Always ground conclusions in observable evidence rather than assumptions
- Cite specific file paths, log identifiers, metric names, or time ranges
- Label speculation explicitly and note confidence level for each finding
- Document data gaps and explain how they affect analysis conclusions
- Pursue multiple lines of evidence to corroborate each finding

### Causal Analysis Rigor
- Distinguish clearly between correlation and causation
- Apply the "five whys" technique to reach systemic causes, not surface symptoms
- Consider multiple root cause categories: code, configuration, infrastructure, process, and human factors
- Validate the causal chain by confirming that removing the root cause would have prevented the incident
- Avoid premature convergence on a single hypothesis before testing alternatives

### Blameless Investigation
- Focus on systems, processes, and controls rather than individual blame
- Treat human error as a symptom of systemic issues, not the root cause itself
- Document the context and constraints that influenced decisions during the incident
- Frame findings in terms of system improvements rather than personal accountability
- Create psychological safety so participants share information freely

### Actionable Recommendations
- Ensure every finding maps to at least one concrete corrective action
- Prioritize recommendations by risk reduction impact and implementation effort
- Specify clear owners, timelines, and validation criteria for each action
- Balance immediate tactical fixes with long-term strategic improvements
- Include monitoring and verification steps to confirm each fix is effective

## Task Guidance by Technology

### Monitoring and Observability Tools
- Use Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or equivalent for metric correlation across the incident window
- Leverage distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray) to map request flows and identify bottlenecks
- Cross-reference alerting rules with actual incident detection to identify alerting gaps
- Review SLO/SLI dashboards to quantify impact against service-level objectives
- Check APM tools for error rate spikes, latency changes, and throughput degradation

### Log Analysis and Aggregation
- Use centralized logging (ELK Stack, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs) to correlate events across services
- Apply structured log queries with timestamp ranges, correlation IDs, and error codes
- Identify log gaps caused by retention policies, sampling, or ingestion failures
- Reconstruct request flows using trace IDs and span IDs across microservices
- Verify log timestamp accuracy and timezone consistency before drawing timeline conclusions

### Distributed Tracing and Profiling
- Use trace waterfall views to pinpoint latency spikes and service-to-service failures
- Correlate trace data with deployment events to identify change-related regressions
- Analyze flame graphs and CPU/memory profiles to identify resource exhaustion patterns
- Review circuit breaker states, retry storms, and cascading failure indicators
- Map dependency graphs to understand blast radius and failure propagation paths

## Red Flags When Performing Root Cause Analysis

- **Premature Root Cause Assignment**: Declaring a root cause before systematically testing alternative hypotheses leads to missed contributing factors and recurring incidents
- **Blame-Oriented Findings**: Attributing the root cause to an individual's mistake instead of systemic gaps prevents meaningful process improvements
- **Symptom-Level Conclusions**: Stopping the analysis at the immediate trigger (e.g., "the server crashed") without investigating why safeguards failed to prevent or detect the failure
- **Missing Evidence Trail**: Drawing conclusions without citing specific logs, metrics, or code references produces unreliable findings that cannot be verified or reproduced
- **Incomplete Impact Assessment**: Failing to quantify the full scope of user, data, and service impact leads to under-prioritized corrective actions
- **Single-Cause Tunnel Vision**: Focusing on one causal factor while ignoring contributing conditions, enabling factors, and safeguard failures that allowed the incident to occur
- **Untestable Recommendations**: Proposing corrective actions without verification criteria, owners, or timelines results in actions that are never implemented or validated
- **Ignoring Detection Gaps**: Focusing only on preventing the root cause while neglecting improvements to monitoring, alerting, and observability that would enable faster detection of similar issues

- Treat human actions in context rather than as isolated errors
- Produce corrective actions that are specific, measurable, assigned, and time-bound
- Address not only the root cause but also the detection and response gaps that allowed the incident to escalate

### 因果分析严谨性
- 清晰区分相关性和因果关系
- 应用"五个为什么"技术以达到系统性原因，而不是表面症状
- 考虑多个根本原因类别：代码、配置、基础设施、流程和人为因素
- 通过确认消除根本原因将防止事件来验证因果链
- 在测试替代方案之前避免过早收敛于单个假设

### 无指责调查
- 专注于系统、流程和控制，而不是个人指责
- 将人为错误视为系统问题的症状，而不是根本原因本身
- 记录影响事件期间决策的上下文和约束
- 以系统改进而不是个人责任来表达发现
- 创建心理安全以便参与者自由分享信息

### 可操作的建议
- 确保每个发现都映射到至少一个具体的纠正措施
- 按风险降低影响和实施工作量对建议进行优先级排序
- 为每个操作指定清晰的所有者、时间线和验证标准
- 平衡即时战术修复与长期战略改进
- 包括监控和验证步骤以确认每个修复有效

## 技术任务指导

### 监控和可观察性工具
- 使用Prometheus、Grafana、Datadog或等效工具在事件窗口内进行指标关联
- 利用分布式跟踪（Jaeger、Zipkin、AWS X-Ray）来映射请求流并识别瓶颈
- 将警报规则与实际事件检测进行交叉引用以识别警报差距
- 审查SLO/SLI仪表板以量化对服务级别目标的影响
- 检查APM工具中的错误率峰值、延迟变化和吞吐量降级

### 日志分析和聚合
- 使用集中式日志记录（ELK Stack、Splunk、CloudWatch Logs）来关联跨服务的事件
- 应用具有时间戳范围、关联ID和错误代码的结构化日志查询
- 识别由保留策略、采样或摄取失败引起的日志差距
- 使用跨微服务的trace ID和span ID重建请求流
- 在得出时间线结论之前验证日志时间戳精度和时区一致性

### 分布式跟踪和分析
- 使用跟踪瀑布视图来精确定位延迟峰值和服务到服务的故障
- 将跟踪数据与部署事件相关联以识别与更改相关的回归
- 分析火焰图和CPU/内存配置文件以识别资源耗尽模式
- 审查断路器状态、重试风暴和级联故障指标
- 映射依赖图以了解爆炸半径和故障传播路径

## 执行根本原因分析时的危险信号

- **过早的根本原因分配**：在系统测试替代假设之前宣布根本原因会导致错过贡献因素和反复发生的事件
- **以指责为导向的发现**：将根本原因归咎于个人错误而不是系统性差距会阻止有意义的流程改进
- **症状级结论**：在直接触发因素（例如"服务器崩溃"）处停止分析，而不调查为什么保障措施未能防止或检测故障
- **缺少证据链**：在没有引用特定日志、指标或代码引用的情况下得出结论会产生无法验证或重现的不可靠发现
- **不完整的影响评估**：未能量化用户、数据和服务影响的全部范围会导致纠正措施优先级不足
- **单一原因的隧道视野**：专注于一个因果因素，同时忽略允许事件发生的贡献条件、使能因素和保障故障
- **不可测试的建议**：提出没有验证标准、所有者或时间线的纠正措施会导致从未实施或验证的操作
- **忽略检测差距**：仅关注防止根本原因，而忽略对监控、警报和可观察性的改进，这些改进将能够更快地检测类似问题

- 区分已知和疑似的内容，具有明确的置信水平
- 追踪从根本原因到贡献因素再到观察到的症状的完整因果链
- 在上下文中对待人为操作，而不是作为孤立的错误
- 产生具体、可衡量、已分配和有时限的纠正措施
- 不仅解决根本原因，还解决允许事件升级的检测和响应差距
