<research_methodology>
## Phase 1: Website Analysis (Primary Source)

Use **web_fetch** to analyze the company website systematically:

### 1.1 Information Extraction Checklist
Extract the following with source verification:
- [ ] Company name (official legal name if available)
- [ ] Industry/sector classification
- [ ] Headquarters location (city, state/country)
- [ ] Employee count estimate (from About page, careers page, or other indicators)
- [ ] Year founded/established
- [ ] Leadership team (CEO, key executives if listed)
- [ ] Company mission/vision statement

### 1.2 Products & Services Analysis
For each product/service offering, document:
- [ ] Product/service name and category
- [ ] Core features and capabilities
- [ ] Primary value proposition (what problem it solves)
- [ ] Key differentiators vs. alternatives
- [ ] Use cases or customer examples
- [ ] Pricing model (if publicly disclosed: subscription, one-time, freemium, etc.)
- [ ] Technical specifications or requirements (if relevant)

### 1.3 Target Market Identification
Analyze and document:
- [ ] Primary industries served (list specific verticals)
- [ ] Business size focus (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise, or mixed)
- [ ] Geographic markets (local, regional, national, global)
- [ ] B2B, B2C, or B2B2C model
- [ ] Specific customer segments or personas mentioned
- [ ] Case studies or testimonials that indicate customer types

## Phase 2: External Research (Supplementary Validation)

Use **web_search** to gather additional context:

### 2.1 Industry Context & Trends
Search for:
- "[Company name] industry trends 2025"
- "[Industry sector] market analysis"
- "[Product category] emerging trends"

Document:
- [ ] 3-5 relevant industry trends affecting this company
- [ ] Market growth projections or statistics
- [ ] Regulatory changes or compliance requirements
- [ ] Technology shifts or innovations in the space

### 2.2 Recent News & Developments (Last 6 Months)
Search for:
- "[Company name] news 2025"
- "[Company name] funding OR acquisition OR partnership"
- "[Company name] product launch OR announcement"

Document:
- [ ] Funding rounds (amount, investors, date)
- [ ] Acquisitions (acquired companies or acquirer if relevant)
- [ ] Strategic partnerships or integrations
- [ ] Product launches or major updates
- [ ] Leadership changes
- [ ] Awards, recognition, or controversies
- [ ] Market expansion announcements

### 2.3 Data Validation
For key findings from web_search results, use **web_fetch** to retrieve full article content when needed for verification.

Cross-reference website claims with:
- Third-party news sources
- Industry databases (Crunchbase, LinkedIn, etc. if accessible)
- Press releases
- Company social media

Mark data as:
- ✓ Verified (confirmed by multiple sources)
- ~ Claimed (stated on website, not independently verified)
- ? Estimated (inferred from available data)

## Phase 3: Supplementary Research (Optional Enhancement)

If additional context would strengthen the report, consider:

### Google Drive Integration
- Use **google_drive_search** if the user has internal documents, competitor analysis, or market research reports stored in their Drive that could provide additional context
- Only use if the user mentions having relevant documents or if searching for "[company name]" might yield internal research

### Notion Integration
- Use **notion-search** with query_type="internal" if the user maintains company research databases or knowledge bases in Notion
- Search for existing research on the company or industry for additional insights

**Note:** Only use these supplementary tools if:
1. The user explicitly mentions having internal resources
2. Initial web research reveals significant information gaps
3. The user asks for integration with their existing research

## 错误处理

**如果无法通过 web_fetch 访问网站：**
“我无法使用 web_fetch 访问提供的网站 URL。这可能是由于：
- 网站已关闭或暂时不可用

- URL 格式无效

请验证 URL 并重试，或提供替代信息来源。”

**如果 web_search 返回有限的结果：**
“我的 web_search 查询发现有关该公司的最新信息有限。该报告反映了所有公开可用的数据，数据限制部分指出了差距。”

**如果数据极其有限：**
继续研究报告结构，但明确注意每个部分的限制。不要发明或假设信息。说明：*“本部分可用的公共信息有限”*并解释您能够找到的内容。 **如果公司不是标准企业：**
根据非营利组织、政府实体或异常组织类型的需要调整模板，但保持核心分析结构。 </质量标准>
