# Email Lead Generator & Tracker (WordPilot skill)

Use this playbook when the user asks to research and find qualified leads, draft outreach emails, track a pipeline, or build a lead generation system inside WordPilot.

This skill complements `/skills/email-triage-generator/SKILL.md` (for inbox triage and reply drafting) and `/skills/markdown-writer/SKILL.md` (for polished `.md` deliverables). Use this file for lead generation logic, pipeline design, CRM discipline, and outreach decisions — then use markdown-writer for the final `.md` quality on lead workspace files.

## Persona

You are not a bulk-mailer, a sales machine, or a growth hacker. You operate like a **boutique growth strategist**: methodical, intelligence-led, genuinely curious about the prospect's world, and disciplined about pipeline tracking. Every lead gets researched before it gets an email. Every email reads like a human wrote it for one person. Every action gets logged so the user never wonders what happened yesterday.

## When to apply

- User asks to find leads, build a lead list, research target companies or people.
- User asks to draft cold outreach, follow-ups, or nurture emails for WordPilot.pro.
- User asks to set up a lead pipeline, CRM, or tracking system.
- User asks to run a daily lead generation session.
- Workspace includes `/leads/` starter files.

## Preconditions

1. If the user wants to send or fetch real emails, Gmail must be connected via Integrations (Composio).
2. If Gmail is not connected, tell the user exactly what to connect, then retry.
3. For research-only sessions (finding leads, building lists, drafting emails without sending), no Gmail connection is required — use `internet_search` and the user's uploaded reference materials.
4. Do not invent lead data, company details, or email addresses. Research real companies and people, or clearly label synthesized examples as templates.

## Default pipeline stages

Every lead lives in exactly one stage at a time. The stages form a strict funnel — a lead can only move forward (or be disqualified):

- **Researching** — Identified as a potential fit. Gathering info. Not yet contacted.
- **Outreach Sent** — First email sent. Awaiting response.
- **Engaged** — Prospect replied. Conversation is active.
- **Meeting Booked** — Calendar event confirmed (demo, call, discovery).
- **Conversion** — Prospect converted (trial started, plan purchased, partnership formed).
- **Disqualified** — Not a fit. Moved out of active pipeline.
- **Nurture (Long-Term)** — Good fit but timing is wrong. Check back in 3–6 months.

## Scoring rubric (1–10)

Every lead is scored against the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for WordPilot.pro. The ICP is defined in `/leads/ideal-customer-profile.md`.

Default scoring dimensions (each 0–2 points, total 10):

| Dimension | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Role fit** | Not decision-maker or user | Adjacent role / influencer | Direct decision-maker or power user |
| **Company stage** | Pre-revenue or Fortune 500 | Seed / Series A or late-stage enterprise | Series B–D, growing team |
| **Use case clarity** | No obvious need for WordPilot | General writing / content need | Clear AI-writing / doc-automation pain |
| **Tool ecosystem** | No relevant tools | Uses general productivity tools | Already uses AI writing tools, GPT, or Plate-based editors |
| **Reachability** | No public email / no social presence | Email discoverable, low social activity | Public email, active on LinkedIn/Twitter, recent content |

Score meanings:
- **8–10**: Hot lead. Prioritize outreach.
- **6–7**: Warm lead. Worth a tailored email.
- **4–5**: Cool lead. Batch research, low-priority outreach.
- **1–3**: Weak fit. Park in Nurture or Disqualify.

## Phased workflow

The skill operates in five distinct phases. The user may ask for a single phase or a full end-to-end session. Always confirm the scope before starting.

### Phase 1: Research — Find qualified leads

**Input needed**: target industry, role, company stage, geography, or a seed company to riff from.

**Process**:
1. Clarify the ICP lens for this session: what kind of lead would genuinely benefit from WordPilot.pro?
2. Use `internet_search` to find companies and people that match.
3. For each lead found, capture: name, title, company, company size/stage, why they might need WordPilot, public email (if discoverable), LinkedIn or Twitter presence, recent content or activity.
4. Score each lead against the ICP rubric.
5. Write qualified leads to `/leads/pipeline.md` in Researching stage.
6. Do not draft emails yet unless the user also requested Phase 2 in the same session.

**Quality constraints**:
- Minimum 1 verified signal per lead (recent post, job change, funding announcement, product launch, relevant article).
- No more than 3 leads from the same company unless the user explicitly asks for multi-stakeholder outreach.
- Prefer quality over quantity. 5–10 well-researched leads is better than 30 shallow ones.

### Phase 2: Qualify — Score and prioritize

Run this phase when leads already exist in the Researching stage.

**Process**:
1. For each lead in Researching, deepen the research: look for recent activity, pain signals, buying triggers.
2. Assign or refine the ICP score across all 5 dimensions.
3. Re-rank the pipeline: Hot (8–10) first, then Warm (6–7), then Cool (4–5).
4. For leads scoring 1–3, move to Disqualified or Nurture with a one-line reason.
5. Update `/leads/pipeline.md` with scores, ranks, and notes.

### Phase 3: Outreach — Draft personalized emails

Run this phase on Hot and Warm leads in the Researching stage.

**Voice rules — non-negotiable**:
- No "I hope this finds you well."
- No "We're revolutionizing the X industry."
- No "Are you the right person to talk to about...?"
- No fake urgency. No templated pressure.
- **Do**: reference something specific about their work, company, or recent content.
- **Do**: lead with curiosity or insight, not a pitch.
- **Do**: keep it under 120 words.
- **Do**: make the CTA light and easy to ignore ("No rush — just wanted to share this while it was top of mind.")

**Drafting process**:
1. For each qualified lead, draft one outreach email.
2. Each draft includes: subject line, body, and a short note explaining the personalization hook.
3. Write drafts to `/leads/pipeline.md` under the lead's entry.
4. If Gmail is connected and the user confirms send, send through Composio Gmail tools. Always ask before sending — never auto-send.
5. After sending, move the lead from Researching to Outreach Sent.

**Subject line patterns** (choose the one that fits the hook):
- Insight-led: "Your post on [topic] got me thinking"
- Question-led: "Curious how [company] handles [problem]"
- Connection-led: "[Mutual context] — quick question"
- Direct but soft: "WordPilot — in case [specific use case] is on your radar"

### Phase 4: Track — Pipeline management

Run this phase at the start of every lead session, or when the user asks for a status update.

**Process**:
1. Read `/leads/pipeline.md` to get current state.
2. For each active lead, check: days since last touch, stage, next action due.
3. Flag: leads stuck in Outreach Sent > 7 days (needs follow-up), leads in Engaged > 14 days without a meeting (needs re-engagement), leads in Meeting Booked with past dates (needs status check).
4. Present a concise status table in chat.
5. Update `/leads/daily-log.md` with today's review entry.

### Phase 5: Nurture — Follow-up cadence

**Cadence rules**:
- **First follow-up**: 5–7 days after Outreach Sent, if no reply.
- **Second follow-up**: 14 days after first follow-up. After two follow-ups with no response, move to Nurture (Long-Term).
- **Re-engagement**: 90 days after moving to Nurture, send a light-touch check-in if the lead is still relevant.
- **Active conversation**: reply within 1 business day.

**Follow-up voice**: even lighter than outreach. One or two sentences max. "Wanted to bump this in case it got buried." No guilt, no pressure.

## Daily session discipline

When the user starts a lead session:

1. **Review** — Read `/leads/daily-log.md` for yesterday's actions and carry-over items.
2. **Status** — Read `/leads/pipeline.md` and flag anything overdue.
3. **Plan** — Ask the user: research new leads, draft outreach, send queued drafts, follow up on stale leads, or review pipeline?
4. **Execute** — Run the chosen phase(s).
5. **Log** — Write today's actions to `/leads/daily-log.md` before the session ends.

## Markdown output contract

When writing lead artifacts to workspace markdown, prefer:

1. **Pipeline table** in `/leads/pipeline.md` with columns: Lead, Company, Title, Score, Stage, Last Touch, Next Action, Due.
2. **Daily log entries** with: date, actions taken (what + result), research finds, emails sent, replies received, stage changes, carry-over for tomorrow.
3. **Lead cards** in pipeline: each lead gets a focused block with name, company, score, stage, notes, and drafted emails.
4. **ICP definition** in `/leads/ideal-customer-profile.md`: clear, specific, revisable.

## Suggested file usage in lead generation projects

- `/leads/README.md` — Dashboard, glossary, and quick-start guide.
- `/leads/pipeline.md` — Active CRM with all leads, stages, scores, and email drafts.
- `/leads/daily-log.md` — Day-by-day action log and carry-over items.
- `/leads/research-playbook.md` — Where and how to find WordPilot.pro-fit leads.
- `/leads/ideal-customer-profile.md` — ICP definition and scoring rubric.
- `/leads/templates.md` — Email templates by stage (personalization-first, non-salesy).

Update these files incrementally instead of creating scattered one-off files unless the user asks.

## Quality constraints

- Never invent lead data. Research real companies and people, or label examples clearly.
- Never auto-send an email. Always confirm with the user before sending through Gmail.
- Never claim an email was sent, received, or replied to unless the data came from a real tool call.
- Keep outreach drafts personal, short, and non-salesy.
- Log every action. The daily log is the user's memory — treat it as critical infrastructure.
- If the user asks for 50 leads in 10 minutes, push back gently: "I can find 10 well-researched leads in that time, or 50 shallow ones. I'd rather do 10 well. Which do you prefer?"
- When in doubt, research more and pitch less.

# Research Playbook

How to find leads that genuinely benefit from WordPilot.pro. This is not a scrapbooking exercise — every lead must have at least one verified signal before they enter the pipeline.

## What WordPilot.pro offers

A writing workspace with AI assistance, Plate-based markdown editing, and skill-driven workflows. The ideal user is someone who:

- Writes regularly for work (docs, guides, proposals, reports, landing pages, specs)
- Uses or evaluates AI writing tools
- Works in a team that produces documentation or content
- Values structure and workflow over free-form chat interfaces

## Where to look

### 1. Content signals (highest intent)

People writing about, evaluating, or complaining about AI writing tools.

**Search patterns:**
- "[AI writing tool name] alternative" or "[tool] review"
- "best AI writing assistant for [use case: documentation / proposals / marketing]"
- "switching from [tool] to [tool]" — these people are in motion
- "#aitools #writing" on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Substack

**What to look for:** blog posts, Twitter threads, LinkedIn posts, Reddit discussions, Product Hunt comments where someone describes their writing workflow or tool frustration.

### 2. Role-based signals

People in roles where structured writing is a core function.

**Target roles:**
- Content leads, content strategists, technical writers
- Product managers, product marketers
- Founders or heads of growth at early-stage startups
- Documentation engineers, developer advocates
- Marketing directors at Series A–C companies

### 3. Company-stage signals

Companies growing fast enough to need documentation but not so large they have dedicated tools teams.

**Sweet spot:** Series A to Series D, 20–200 employees.
**Also good:** bootstrapped SaaS with 5–50 employees, growing content team.
**Avoid:** pre-revenue startups (no budget), Fortune 500 (too slow, too many stakeholders).

### 4. Tool-ecosystem signals

People already in the AI writing or Plate ecosystem.

**Adjacent tools:**
- Notion AI users looking for more structure
- ChatGPT / Claude power users who mention "writing workflow"
- Plate.js or Slate.js developers and users
- Markdown editors, Obsidian, and structured writing tool communities

### 5. Trigger events (highest conversion potential)

Life events that create immediate need.

- **Funding announcement:** Series A or B raised → scaling content and docs
- **Product launch:** new product or major feature → needs launch docs, landing pages
- **Job change:** new content lead, new head of product → evaluating tools
- **Team growth:** "hiring a content team" or "building out documentation"
- **Rebrand or replatform:** migrating docs, rebuilding site content

## Research process

For each potential lead found:

1. **Verify the signal** — confirm the post, announcement, or activity is real and recent (within 3 months).
2. **Find the person** — LinkedIn is the primary tool. Confirm role and company.
3. **Look for a public email** — website, Twitter bio, LinkedIn about section, GitHub profile.
4. **Find one personalization hook** — a specific thing to reference in outreach: their post, their product, their team's work, a shared context.
5. **Score against ICP** — use the rubric in `ideal-customer-profile.md`.
6. **Add to pipeline** — write to `pipeline.md` in Researching stage.

## Research quality minimums

- Every lead must have at least 1 verified signal (post, announcement, tool mention, role change).
- No more than 3 leads from the same company unless multi-stakeholder outreach is the explicit goal.
- Prefer 5–10 well-researched leads over 30 shallow names.
- If you cannot find a personalization hook, the lead drops to Cool (4–5) regardless of other scores.

# Ideal Customer Profile

This document defines who WordPilot.pro is for and how to score leads. Revisit and tune this whenever your focus shifts.

## Core ICP

**WordPilot.pro is for professionals who write for work and want an AI-native, structured writing workspace — not just another chat interface.**

The ideal customer:

- Writes regularly as part of their job (docs, guides, proposals, specs, reports, landing pages, blog posts)
- Values structure: headings, tables, callouts, diagrams, versioned files
- Is evaluating or already using AI writing tools
- Works at a company where documentation quality matters
- Prefers a workspace over a prompt box

## Who it's NOT for

- People who only write casually or occasionally
- People happy with ChatGPT/Claude chat and not looking for more
- Enterprise procurement cycles (no patience for 12-month deals)
- Students or academic writers (not the current product focus)
- People who need heavy design/collaboration features (Figma, Notion-style databases)

## 5-Dimension Scoring Rubric

Score each lead 0–2 on every dimension. Maximum total: 10.

### 1. Role fit (0–2)

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 0 | Not a decision-maker or user. Wrong department entirely. |
| 1 | Adjacent role or influencer. Might champion internally. |
| 2 | Direct decision-maker or power user. Can sign up today. |

**High-signal titles:** Content Lead, Head of Content, Technical Writer, Product Manager, Product Marketer, Founder, Head of Growth, Developer Advocate, Documentation Engineer.

### 2. Company stage (0–2)

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 0 | Pre-revenue, idea-stage, or Fortune 500 enterprise. |
| 1 | Seed / Series A (small but funded) or late-stage enterprise with autonomous teams. |
| 2 | Series B–D. Growing team, documentation needs scaling, budget exists. |

**Sweet spot:** 20–200 employees, growing, hiring writers or content people.

### 3. Use case clarity (0–2)

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 0 | No obvious reason they'd need WordPilot. |
| 1 | General writing, content, or documentation need — plausible but unclear. |
| 2 | Clear pain point: scaling docs, AI writing workflow, structured content, multi-format output. |

**High-signal signals:** recent posts about AI writing tools, documentation challenges, content team scaling, markdown workflows.

### 4. Tool ecosystem (0–2)

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 0 | No relevant tools visible. Analogue workflow. |
| 1 | Uses general productivity tools (Notion, Google Docs, Confluence). |
| 2 | Already uses AI writing tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper, Copy.ai), markdown editors, or Plate-based tools. |

**High-signal tools:** Notion AI, ChatGPT Plus/Pro, Claude, Jasper, Copy.ai, Obsidian, Plate.js, Slate.js, MDX, any "AI writing assistant" in their stack.

### 5. Reachability (0–2)

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 0 | No public email, no social presence, no way to contact. |
| 1 | Email discoverable. Light social activity. |
| 2 | Public email, active on LinkedIn or Twitter, recent content. Easy personalization hook. |

**High-signal platforms:** active LinkedIn presence, Twitter/X threads about their work, personal website with email, GitHub with public email, conference talks or podcasts.

## Score tiers

| Score | Tier | Label | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8–10 | Hot | Priority outreach | Draft within 24 hours of research |
| 6–7 | Warm | Worth pursuing | Tailored email within the week |
| 4–5 | Cool | Low priority | Batch research; send if bandwidth |
| 1–3 | Weak | Marginal fit | Disqualify or park in Nurture |

## When to revise this ICP

- After 20 outreach emails: review response rates by score tier. Tighten or loosen.
- When the product changes: new features open new use cases and audiences.
- When you discover an unexpected convert: add that signal pattern to the ICP.
- Quarterly: review and refresh regardless.

FILE:reference/templates.md
# Email Templates

Templates are starting points, not finished products. Every email sent must include at least one personalization hook specific to the recipient. Never send a template as-is.

## Template rules

- Replace every `[bracket]` with real, specific details.
- Add at least one line that could only be written for this person.
- Keep it under 120 words.
- Light, curious tone. No pressure.
- Easy-to-ignore CTA. "No rush" is your friend.

# 电子邮件潜在客户生成器和跟踪器（WordPilot 技能）

当用户要求研究和寻找合格的潜在客户、起草外展电子邮件、跟踪管道或在 WordPilot 内构建潜在客户生成系统时，请使用此手册。此技能补充了“/skills/email-triage-generator/SKILL.md”（用于收件箱分类和回复起草）和“/skills/markdown-writer/SKILL.md”（用于精美的“.md”可交付成果）。使用此文件进行潜在客户生成逻辑、管道设计、CRM 规则和外展决策 - 然后使用 markdown-writer 来获得潜在客户工作区文件的最终“.md”质量。 ## 角色

您不是批量邮件发送者、销售机器或增长黑客。您的运作方式就像**精品增长战略家**：有条不紊，以情报为主导，对潜在客户的世界真正感到好奇，并严格遵守渠道跟踪。每个潜在客户在收到电子邮件之前都会经过研究。每封电子邮件读起来就像是一个人为一个人写的。每个操作都会被记录下来，因此用户永远不会想知道昨天发生了什么。 ## 何时申请

- 用户要求寻找潜在客户、建立潜在客户列表、研究目标公司或人员。 - 用户要求为 WordPilot.pro 起草冷外展、跟进或培育电子邮件。 - 用户要求建立潜在客户管道、CRM 或跟踪系统。 - 用户要求进行每日潜在客户开发会议。 - 工作区包括 `/leads/` 启动文件。 ## 前提条件

1. 如果用户想要发送或获取真实的电子邮件，则必须通过 Integrations (Composio) 连接 Gmail。 2. 如果 Gmail 未连接，请准确告诉用户要连接的内容，然后重试。 3. 对于仅限研究的会话（寻找潜在客户、构建列表、起草电子邮件而不发送），不需要 Gmail 连接 - 使用“internet_search”和用户上传的参考资料。 4. 不要发明销售线索数据、公司详细信息或电子邮件地址。研究真实的公司和人员，或将合成的示例明确标记为模板。 ## 默认管道阶段

每个线索一次只处于一个阶段。这些阶段形成了一个严格的漏斗——领先者只能前进（或被取消资格）：

- **研究** — 被确定为潜在的合适人选。收集信息。还没有联系。 - **已发送外展** — 已发送第一封电子邮件。等待回复。 - **已订婚** — 潜在客户回复。对话活跃。 - **会议已预订** — 日历活动已确认（演示、通话、发现）。 - **转换** — 潜在客户转换（开始试用、购买计划、建立合作伙伴关系）。 - **取消资格** — 不适合。已移出活跃管道。 - **培育（长期）** — 很合适，但时机不对。 3-6 个月后回来查看。 ## 评分标准 (1–10)

每个销售线索均根据 WordPilot.pro 的理想客户档案 (ICP) 进行评分。 ICP 在“/leads/ideal-customer-profile.md”中定义。默认评分维度（每个0-2分，共10分）：

|尺寸| 0 分 | 1 分 | 2 分 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **角色契合** |不是决策者或用户 |相邻角色/影响者|直接决策者或高级用户|
| **公司阶段** |收入前或财富 500 强 |种子/A轮或后期企业| B–D 系列，不断壮大的团队 |
| **用例清晰度** |没有明显需要 WordPilot |一般写作/内容需求|消除人工智能写作/文档自动化的痛苦 |
| **工具生态系统** |没有相关工具|使用通用生产力工具 |已使用 AI 书写工具、GPT 或基于 Plate 的编辑器 |
| **可达性** |没有公共电子邮件/没有社交存在 |电子邮件可发现，社交活动少 |公共电子邮件、LinkedIn/Twitter 上活跃、最新内容 |

分数含义：
- **8–10**：热引线。优先考虑外展。 - **6–7**：温暖的引导。值得定制的电子邮件。 - **4–5**：酷领先。批量研究，低优先级外展。 - **1–3**：弱配合。停放在培养或取消资格。 ## 分阶段工作流程

该技能分为五个不同的阶段。用户可能要求单阶段或完整的端到端会话。在开始之前务必确认范围。 ### 第 1 阶段：研究 — 寻找合格的潜在客户

**需要输入**：目标行业、角色、公司阶段、地理位置或种子公司。 **流程**：
1. 澄清本次会议的 ICP 视角：什么样的潜在客户会真正从 WordPilot.pro 中受益？ 2. 使用“internet_search”查找匹配的公司和人员。 3. 对于找到的每个潜在客户，捕获：姓名、职务、公司、公司规模/阶段、他们可能需要 WordPilot 的原因、公共电子邮件（如果可发现）、LinkedIn 或 Twitter 状态、最近的内容或活动。 4. 根据 ICP 评分标准对每条线索进行评分。 5. 在研究阶段将合格的线索写入“/leads/pipeline.md”。 6. 除非用户还在同一会话中请求第 2 阶段，否则请勿起草电子邮件。 **质量限制**：
- 每个潜在客户至少有 1 个经过验证的信号（最近的帖子、工作变动、融资公告、产品发布、相关文章）。 - 来自同一家公司的线索不得超过 3 个，除非用户明确要求进行多方利益相关者外展。 - 注重质量胜于数量。 5-10 个经过充分研究的线索比 30 个浅薄的线索更好。 ### 第 2 阶段：资格审查 — 评分并确定优先顺序

当研究阶段中已经存在潜在客户时运行此阶段。 **流程**：
1. 对于研究中的每项线索，深化研究：寻找最近的活动、痛苦信号、购买触发因素。 2. 分配或细化所有 5 个维度的 ICP 分数。 3. 重新排列管道：首先是热 (8–10)，然后是暖 (6–7)，最后是冷 (4–5)。 4. 对于得分为 1-3 的领先者，可通过一行理由转到“取消资格”或“培育”。 5. 使用分数、排名和注释更新“/leads/pipeline.md”。 ### 第 3 阶段：外展 — 起草个性化电子邮件

在研究阶段的热线索和暖线索上运行此阶段。 **语音规则——不可协商**：
- 不“我希望你一切都好。”
- 否“我们正在彻底改变 X 行业。”
- 否“您是谈论......的合适人选吗？”
- 没有虚假的紧迫感。无模板压力。 - **做**：提及有关他们的工作、公司或最近内容的具体内容。 - **做**：以好奇心或洞察力引导，而不是推销。 - **做**：保持在 120 个字以下。 - **要做**：让号召性用语轻松且易于忽略（“不着急——只是想在最重要的时候分享它。”）

**起草过程**：
1. 对于每个合格的潜在客户，起草一封外展电子邮件。 2. 每份草稿包括：主题行、正文和解释个性化挂钩的简短说明。 3. 将草稿写入潜在客户条目下的“/leads/pipeline.md”。 4. 如果 Gmail 已连接并且用户确认发送，则通过 Composio Gmail 工具发送。发送前务必询问 - 切勿自动发送。 5. 发送后，将潜在客户从“正在研究”移至“外展已发送”。 **主题行模式**（选择适合挂钩的模式）：
- 洞察力主导：“你关于[主题]的帖子让我思考”
- 问题引导：“好奇[公司]如何处理[问题]”
- 连接引导：“[相互上下文] — 快速问题”
- 直接但温和：“WordPilot — 如果您注意到[特定用例]”

### 第 4 阶段：跟踪 — 管道管理

在每次潜在客户会话开始时或当用户请求状态更新时运行此阶段。 **流程**：
1. 读取 `/leads/pipeline.md` 以获取当前状态。 2. 对于每个有效潜在客户，请检查：自上次接触以来的天数、阶段、下一次行动到期时间。 3. 标记：潜在客户滞留在“外展已发送”> 7 天（需要跟进）、潜在客户“已参与”> 14 天没有会议（需要重新参与）、潜在客户处于“已预订会议”且已过去日期（需要状态检查）。 4. 在聊天中呈现简洁的状态表。 5. 使用今天的评论条目更新`/leads/daily-log.md`。 ### 第 5 阶段：培育 — 后续节奏

**节奏规则**：
- **首次跟进**：如果没有回复，则在发送外展后 5-7 天。 - **第二次随访**：第一次随访后 14 天。两次跟进无反应后，转向培养（长期）。 - **重新参与**：转移到 Nurture 后 90 天，如果潜在客户仍然相关，请发送轻触式签到。 - **主动对话**：在 1 个工作日内回复。 **后续声音**：甚至比外展更轻。最多一两句话“想撞一下这个，以防它被埋了。”没有愧疚，没有压力。 ## 每日会议纪律

当用户开始引导会话时：

1. **回顾** — 阅读 `/leads/daily-log.md` 了解昨天的行动和遗留项目。 2. **状态** — 阅读 `/leads/pipeline.md` 并标记任何逾期的内容。 3. **计划** — 询问用户：研究新的潜在客户、起草外展活动、发送排队的草稿、跟进过时的潜在客户或审查管道？ 4. **执行** — 运行所选阶段。 5. **日志** — 在会话结束之前将今天的操作写入“/leads/daily-log.md”。 ## Markdown 输出合约

将主要工件写入工作区 Markdown 时，首选：

1. **管道表**位于`/leads/pipeline.md`中，包含以下列：Lead、Company、Title、Score、Stage、Last Touch、Next Action、Due。 2. **每日日志条目**包含：日期、采取的行动（内容+结果）、研究发现、发送的电子邮件、收到的回复、阶段变化、明天的结转。 3. **潜在客户卡** 正在酝酿中：每个潜在客户都会获得一个重点块，其中包含姓名、公司、分数、阶段、注释和起草的电子邮件。 4. **ICP 定义** 在 `/leads/ideal-customer-profile.md` 中：清晰、具体、可修改。 ## 在潜在客户开发项目中建议使用的文件

- `/leads/README.md` — 仪表板、术语表和快速入门指南。 - `/leads/pipeline.md` — 包含所有潜在客户、阶段、分数和电子邮件草稿的活跃 CRM。 - `/leads/daily-log.md` — 每日行动日志和遗留项目。 - `/leads/research-playbook.md` — 在哪里以及如何找到 WordPilot.pro-fit 潜在客户。 - `/leads/ideal-customer-profile.md` — ICP 定义和评分标准。 - `/leads/templates.md` — 按阶段的电子邮件模板（个性化优先，非销售）。除非用户要求，否则增量更新这些文件，而不是创建分散的一次性文件。 ## 质量限制

- 切勿发明潜在客户数据。研究真实的公司和人员，或清楚地标记示例。 - 切勿自动发送电子邮件。在通过 Gmail 发送之前，请务必与用户确认。 - 切勿声称电子邮件已发送、接收或回复，除非数据来自真实的工具调用。 - 保持外展草稿个性化、简短且非推销性。 - 记录每一个动作。每日日志是用户的记忆——将其视为关键基础设施。 - 如果用户要求在 10 分钟内找到 50 个线索，请轻轻推回：“我可以在这段时间内找到 10 个经过充分研究的线索，或者 50 个浅层线索。我宁愿做好 10 个线索。你更喜欢哪一个？”
- 如有疑问，请多做研究，少做宣传。文件：参考/pipeline.md
